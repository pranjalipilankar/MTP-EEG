Label:
The labels of the three sessions for the same subjects are as follows,
session1_label = [1,2,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,2,2,3,3,0,3,0,3];
session2_label = [2,1,3,0,0,2,0,2,3,3,2,3,2,0,1,1,2,1,0,3,0,1,3,1];
session3_label = [1,2,2,1,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,0,2,3,3,0,2,3,0,0,2,0,1,0];

The labels with 0, 1, 2, and 3 denote the ground truth, neutral, sad, fear, and happy emotions, respectively.

The size of the sliding time windows for feature extraction is 4 seconds.
